We carefully selected our first speakers to show you in which direction we want the conference to go. There are several **more 20min slots** *without Q&A session afterwards* so we invite you and the entire web development and UX community to **propose a talk for .concat()**.

This is a web development and UX conference, so we want to hear talks about frontend and backend development, security, design, typography, accessibility, open source and our culture.
But if you think our attendees will benefit from you hacking on robots or talking about [bacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRVUKCQw7qU) that’s totally fine as well.

Just remember: We will always favor an original, outside of the box talk, or one that explains concepts and the bigger picture over a “A sucks, use B instead” talk. Get creative and surprise us.

No matter if you’re an experienced speaker or a newcomer who has never spoken at a conference before: **We are interested in what you have to say**. We aim for a **diverse lineup with a fine selection of topics**, that come from everywhere out of this community.

You feel like you don't have anything to talk about? We feel you – we all know this feeling, but **we’re here to help you**.

We want to support our speakers and thus will **cover their travel and accommodation**. We hope this will help you in your decision to submit a talk and we will do our best to get you and your talk to Salzburg.

So please go ahead, pick your topic and [submit a talk](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsqaGmwRfMLFbImrCuB_-r09KIV6AgC5LMQFf64V53OAEuVw/viewform)!

Still not sure? Neele, Lisi & Hannes would be happy to hear from you and help you make your talk a reality. [Contact us](mailto:talks@conc.at)!
